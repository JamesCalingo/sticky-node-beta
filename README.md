# sticky-node-beta

This is essentially a design prototype of something I want to work on in the very near future.

The project I have in mind is full stack, but I'm still trying to figure out the back end of it, so until then here's a (mostly) working prototype of the frontend of it. Currently, I have adding notes to the page and deleting notes working, and am working on using local storage to save notes and allow the user to restore their notes when reloading/returning to the app.
